<h1>Welcome to my resume!</h1>

<p>I am Fernando Ureña Gómez who dreams of carving out a niche for himself in the world of
    computing. Especially in the world of programming.</p>

<p>I'm on the path of computer learning and I want to share little by little the knowledge I acquire to
    help people with technical problems that may arise.</p>

<p>I'm just one more person in this world who wants to contribute their grain of sand, to help others in what
    can. I love the topic of training and being able to help others.</p>
